## How to set up the motors:

Hey future Fontys MINOR pixel farming group. Here is a guide on how to setup the motors so that they move.

#### Wiring

Here is an image of how to wire the ODESC 3.6 motor controller:

The power resister is Polarity-insensitive. 
Note that the Quinder 8” 48V DC Brushless HUB motor already has encoders build in. <br>
Here you can see an image of how the motors are connected (pls excuse the wire colour):

#### Configuration:

The ODESC might already be configured. If not then please connect your pc to it with a micro usb-cable.

To configure the ODESC you need the odrivetool. It can be downloaded via python.
